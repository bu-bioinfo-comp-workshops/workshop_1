# Results Directory

This directory is where your analysis results and reports will be saved.

## Expected Files

After completing the workshop, you should have:

- `results.md` - Numerical results from your sequence analysis
- `summary_report.md` - Your brief analysis report for the PI
- `gc_content_plot.png` - Optional visualization of GC content (if you complete the visualization component)
- `base_composition_pie.png` - Optional pie chart of base composition
- Additional plots from the visualization script (optional)

## File Descriptions

### `results.md`
- Contains the raw numerical results from your analysis
- Sequence length, GC content percentage, base composition
- Generated automatically by your analysis script

### `summary_report.md`
- Your written interpretation of the results
- Should be clear enough to share with your PI
- Include any challenges you encountered and how you solved them

### Visualization Files (Optional)
- PNG image files containing plots and charts
- Generated by the `visualize_results.py` script
- Help communicate your findings visually

## Best Practices

1. **Clear file naming** - Use descriptive names for any additional files
2. **Include metadata** - Add timestamps and analysis parameters
3. **Document methods** - Explain how results were generated
4. **Version control** - Commit results to git for reproducibility

## Quality Check

Before submitting, verify that your results:
- [ ] Are scientifically reasonable (GC content between 0-100%)
- [ ] Include proper units and formatting
- [ ] Are clearly documented and explained
- [ ] Can be reproduced by running your scripts
