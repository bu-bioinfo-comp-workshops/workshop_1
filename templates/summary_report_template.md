# Workshop 1: Ancient DNA Analysis Summary Report

**Student:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Date]  
**Workshop:** Ancient DNA Data Download and Analysis

## Executive Summary

[Write 2-3 sentences summarizing what you accomplished in this workshop and your key findings.]

## Objective

The goal of this workshop was to download an ancient mitochondrial genome from a public database and calculate basic sequence statistics to answer the question: "What are the basic characteristics of this ancient mitochondrial genome?"

## Methods

### Data Acquisition
- **Database Used:** [NCBI/AADR/Other]
- **Sequence Selected:** [Accession ID and brief description]
- **Download Method:** [Brief description of your approach]

### Analysis Approach
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Key Steps:** 
  1. [Step 1 - e.g., Downloaded FASTA file]
  2. [Step 2 - e.g., Parsed sequence data]
  3. [Step 3 - e.g., Calculated statistics]

## Results

### Key Findings
- **Sequence Length:** [X] base pairs
- **GC Content:** [X.X]% 
- **Most Abundant Base:** [A/T/G/C] ([X.X]%)
- **Least Abundant Base:** [A/T/G/C] ([X.X]%)

### Biological Interpretation
[Write 2-3 sentences interpreting what these results mean biologically. For example: Is the GC content typical for mitochondrial DNA? How does the sequence length compare to expected values?]
